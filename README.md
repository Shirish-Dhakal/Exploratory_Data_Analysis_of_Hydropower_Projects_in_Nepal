Title
Hydropower Projects Data Analysis

Introduction
A complete exploratory and predictive analysis of hydropower project data from Nepal.

Dataset
Developer, Project Name, Location
Capacity (MW), PPA Signing Date, Commercial Operation Date
Completion Time, Project Age

Technologies Used
Python
Pandas
Matplotlib, Seaborn
Scikit-learn (for regression)

What I Did
ðŸ“Š Data Cleaning and Preprocessing
ðŸ“ˆ Trend Analysis (PPA Date trends, Capacity growth)
ðŸ§  Comparative Analysis (Large vs Small Projects, Older vs Newer)
ðŸ”¥ Correlation Study
ðŸ“ˆ Regression Modeling (Prediction of Completion Times)

Results
Identified boom periods in hydropower development.
Showed relationships between project capacity, age, and completion time.
Built simple regression models with interpretable results.
